// Set the layout to be used when the page is configured to show content only.

// This is not used because pages have a dedicated template for each layout.
// Each page template contains the appropriate layout class e.g. "layout-narrow-container"
// to achieve the desired layout.
// The following code is left commented out as an idea for further customization.
.page .layout-content-only {
	/* Use one, comment out others. */
	
	// Something custom...
	// This could be a new layout defined like the others in /partials/_layouts.scss 
	// @extend .layout-something-custom;
	
	// Contain content to narrow cell.
	// @extend .layout-narrow-container;
	
	// Contain content to wide cell.
	// @extend .layout-wide-container;
	
	// Do not contain content. Allow it to expand to fill viewport.
	// @extend .layout-full-width;
}
